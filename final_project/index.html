Super nice guy and is very meticulous with the cut. Only accepts cash, so hit the atm before you go! Would highly recommend!"</i> - Frank</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Brought both my sons in today for hair cuts. Had a lovely experience. This place has old-school barbershop vibes. Like the place, I grew up going to with my dad as a kid. Young was kind and meticulous. Looking forward to coming here again."</i> - Gracie</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>"Was looking for a good barbershop for a while now... Even since I relocated to the US I had a problem with chain salons that lacked in quality and consistency. Every time I found someone who could cut my hair right (rarely happened), he would leave the shop in a couple of months. Then I found Young's shop and after the first two times he cut my hair I was sold! The BEST high-and-tight haircut I ever got. He is very detail oriented and he gets it right every. single. time. And come on guys, it's a barbershop. Aren't you tired of hair salons? It's about time you found someone who specializes in men's haircuts."</i> - Bob</p>
