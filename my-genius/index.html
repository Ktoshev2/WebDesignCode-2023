        <h1>My """"Genius"""": <i>The Piano</i></h1>
        <center><img src="image_files/Piano.png" alt="Picture of a piano"></center>
        <p>I have been playing the piano for about five years now.</p>
        <p>As a classical pianist focused on late Romance music,</p>
        <p>most of what I learn and perform was written by the three people below:</p>
        <center>

        </center>
        <p style="font-size: 14px"><i>Frederick Chopin (1810-1849). Born in Zelazowa Wola, Poland, died in Paris, France.</i></p>
        <p style="font-size: 14px"><i>Some of his pieces that I have performed include his Ballade in F major, Revolutionary Etude, and his Minute Waltz</i></p>

            <img src="image_files/rachmaninoff_portrait.jpg" alt="Portrait of Sergei Rachmaninoff" width="300">
        </center>
        <p style="font-size: 14px"><i>Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873-1943). Born in Starorussky Uyezd, Russia, died Beverly Hills, CA.</i></p>
        <p style="font-size: 14px"><i>Some of his pieces that I have performed include his Prelude in C Sharp Minor, and his Etude-Tableaux No. 4</i></p>
        <center>
            <img src="image_files/ravel_portrait.jpg" alt="Portrait of Maurice Ravel" width="300">
        </center>
        <p style="font-size: 14px"><i>Sergei Rachmaninoff (1875-1937). Born in Ciboure, France, died Paris, France.</i></p>
        <p style="font-size: 14px"><i>Some of his pieces that I have performed include his À la manière de Borodine/Chabrier, Le Tombeau de Couperin, and Ondine</i></p>
        <h1>How do I learn and practice pieces?</h1>
        <h2>Chopin's Ballade No. 2 as an example:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The first step for me when I learn a piece is to listen to it whilst</p>
        <p>following along on the sheet music. When listening, I break the piece up into</p>
        <p>stylistic or technical sections distinct from each other.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Once I have all sections divided, I count and number them. The hardest sections</p>
        <p>have the lowest numbers, and the easiest sections have the highest numbers.</p>
        <p>I then allot a certain amount of minutes per practice session to each section according</p>
        <p>to its number.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From there, I have three main methods of actually practicing the music.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Using a Metronome</h2>
        <p>The first method consists of using a metronome, obviously, to keep a steady tempo when drilling</p>
        <p>through unfamiliar music. Once I become proficient in mundane technical work, I move to the second method:</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Slow, Soft, and Melodic Practice</h2>
        <p>Being capable of the basic technique of a section of the piece allows me to begin to focus on the</p>
        <p>interpretation and musicality of it. Nobody likes to hear a robot bash on the keyboard, after all.</p>
        <p>To further increase my technical proficiency, I do this while playing the section slowly, and as soft as possible.</p>
        <p>The key here is to realize that playing softly actually requires far more technical capability and skill than</p>
        <p>playing loudly, as it requires more control of the hands. Once I can comfortably run through the entire piece like this, I move to</p>
        <p>the final method:</p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Pencil Method</h2>
        <p>The "pencil method" first entails grabbing a pile of 2 to 10 pencils and putting them on the left side of my piano.</p>
        <p>Then, I run through a given section of a piece. If I am satisfied by my performance and cannot find any noticeable flaws,</p>
        <p>I move one pencil to the right side of the piano. If I am not satisfied, I move one pencil back to the left side.</p>
        <p>Finally, I continue playing the section over and over again until all pencils are on the right side of my piano.</p>
        <p>A potential flaw in this method arises from not scrutinizing the playing deeeply enough, and so I make sure to be as</p>
        <p>musically brutal as possible in the analysis of my performance.</p>
        <br>

        <p>This is the exact practice routine I am using to prepare for the October 28th Pacific NW</p>
        <p>Piano Competition. Wish me luck!</p>
