        <h1>Musical Picture Gallery</h1>
        <br>
        <p>This page is a gallery of pictures involving both my experience with the piano, and the books I used over time:</p>
        <br>
        <center><img src="image_files/Giant_book.jpeg" alt="My First Music Book" width="400"></center>
        <p>The Giant Book of Intermediate Classical Piano Music was my first proper music book.</p>
        <p>I had used basic exercise booklets before, but this book got me into actually fostering musicality.</p>
        <br>
        <center><img src="image_files/WTC.jpeg" alt="The Well Tempered Clavier" width="400"></center>
        <p>The Well Tempered Clavier, a set of two baroque pieces for all 24 major and minor keys, allowed</p>
        <p>me to begin working on my technique and musicality simultaneously in a more sophisticated way.</p>
        <br>
        <center><img src="image_files/Current_book.jpeg" alt="Current Music Book" width="400"></center>
        <p>The current music book I use is nothing more than a binder full of printed out pieces which I learn.</p>
        <br>
        <center><img src="image_files/recital.jpg" alt="Picture of Me and My Teacher at a Recital" width="400"></center>
        <p>This is a picture of me and my teacher right after a recital. The pieces I performed at this specific recital were</p>
        <p>Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C Sharp Minor, Chopin's Nocturne in C Sharp Minor,</p>
        <p>Chopin's "Revolutionary" Etude, and Ravel's "A la maniere de Emannuel Chabrier".</p>
